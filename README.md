# ☁️ Weather Forecasting App

Welcome to the Weather Forecasting App! This is a dynamic, client-side web application built using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript to fetch and display real-time weather and air pollution data for any city worldwide.

## ✨ Features

* **Real-time Weather Data:** Displays current temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
* **Air Pollution Index (AQI):** Provides the current air quality status for the location.
* **Dynamic UI:** Uses CSS (Bootstrap) and JavaScript for a responsive and engaging user interface, including visual effects using `animate.min.css` and `wow.min.js`.
* **Easy Deployment:** Hosted on Netlify for continuous deployment from the `main` branch.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (with custom styles and Bootstrap)
* **Functionality:** Pure JavaScript (`script_main.js`, `script_airpoll.js`)
* **APIs:** Utilizes a third-party Weather API to fetch data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser and familiarity with JavaScript.

### Installation (Local Setup)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Satyajeet-0000/Weather-Forcasting.git](https://github.com/Satyajeet-0000/Weather-Forcasting.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Weather-Forcasting
    ```
3.  **Open the file:** Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to run the application locally.

### API Key Setup (If required)

*Note: Since this is a client-side application, your API key is likely hardcoded in your JavaScript files (`script_main.js` or similar). For production use, it is recommended to secure your API key using a serverless function (like Netlify Functions).*

## 🌐 Live Deployment

The application is continuously deployed via Netlify:

* **Live URL:** `[INSERT YOUR NETLIFY URL HERE]` (e.g., `https://satyajeet-weather-app.netlify.app/`)
* **Deployment Method:** Continuous Deployment (CD) is configured to automatically build and deploy every time changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
